### About wind observation data

 * Wind speed observations source: [Iowa Environmental Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml?network=AK_ASOS), run by Iowa State University. Houses data collected by the [Automated Surface Observing System](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/automated-surface-observing-system-asos) network and the [Automated Weather Observing System](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/automated-weather-observing-system-awos).
 * Measurement frequency: Varies between locations, from every 5 minutes to every 3 hours. Winds were measured hourly in most cases; speeds were averaged to the nearest hour in cases where measurements were more frequent.
 * Observing site criteria: We use data from 67 observing sites located across Alaska, mostly at airports (see map). For inclusion here, a station must have made 4 or more hourly wind measurements on at least 75&percnt; of the days during the period 1980&ndash;2014.

##### Data processing and quality control

 * Data were adjusted for homogeneity because some instrument heights (now 10 m) and/or precise locations have changed since 1980.
 * Wind speeds at 28 stations showed a statistically significant change from one part of the record to the next. Therefore we adjusted the data prior to the change using quantile mapping, a typical method for correcting biased meteorological data.
 * Four stations displayed two discontinuities. For these, we applied the quantile mapping adjustments to the later period.
 * We also removed obviously wrong reports (e.g., wind speeds exceeding 100 mph) and short-duration (< 6 hour) spikes in which an hourly wind speed was at least 30 mph greater than in the immediately preceding and subsequent hours.
